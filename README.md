>Jasper Ladkin 
>Bachelors of Computer Science 
>Throughout studying at Westminster College, not only have I built a great foundation in computer programming but expanded critical thinking, technical >writing and communication skills and practices. Outlined below are a set of projects highlighting these skills across all four years of my bachelors >degree. These projects are in a descending order (newest â†’ oldest) to highlight my most recent work.


**Artificial Intellience Project** :
>   In this project I worked with the classic game Pacman. In this section we implemented search algoithms, DFS(Depth First Search) and BFS(Breadth First Search) 
>for Pacman agents, and studied the hueristics of a succesful agent. Studying how each search algorithm helps the pacman agents traverse the board with each algorithm 
>with the intended goal of building a pacman agent that wins every game. This project shows how I have developed effective problem solving skills and a demonstrates my 
>understanding of software design. This project was difficult for me, but after working through the concept I have a greater understanding of developing artificial 
>intelligence agents.

**NumberNinja** :
>   NumberNinja is a web game designed for learning basic mathematical concepts such as addition, subtraction, and number recognition. Built in a group of four,
> my main focus was on the back-end implementation of the prompted questions for the students to answer. In the file there is a concept write-up providing more 
>information about the game design and intended goals, as well as the webBuild and the three implementations of the prompted questions. This project gave me 
>great experience working in a group setting and delegating resources to produce a well rounded project.
