&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout studying at Westminster College, not only have I built a great foundation in computer programming but expanded critical thinking, technical writing and communication skills and practices. Outlined below are a set of projects highlighting these skills across all four years of my bachelors degree. <br />

## **SnowPro:** *Mobile Application to record and share snowpack data*

####  **Description:**
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avalanche safety professionals need a mass of accurate snowpack data to build reports and forecast conditions for backcountry users to stay safe when accessing the outdoors.  To help provide data and tools for backcountry users, I designed and implemented a mobile application that the community can use to build a data bank of observations taken in the field.

#### **Reflection:**

I chose this project because it shows the well-rounded programmer I have become. Before this project I didn't have any mobile-development experience. To learn new technologies and skills I set out to build SnowPro with the goals:

1. Learn new technologies and Languages
2. Improve Time-Management Skills
3. Build a product to help the outdoor community

Over the course I the project I was not only able to meet my goals as well a those set by the College. This project has provided me with a great amount of problem solving skills and individual development practices. Working with many new technologies caused me to run into many different issues along the development process. Some of these forced me to critically think through the errors individually, but when I was unable to find a solution, I learned how to clearly and effectively communicate with my peers for some help. 

Although the mobile application is not complete and deployed, I hope to finish the application when time and resources are availible!

#### **Reflection:**

This project shows the collaboration between myself and three of my peers. My main focus was on the back-end implementation of the prompted questions for the students to answer, but also worked with my peers on game design and functionality. To ensure the curriculum was accurate, I worked with elementary school tutors to find an accruate and helpful curriculum for the students playing the game. After completing this project I had a greater understanding of local storage of resources and building web applications. Additionaly this project gave me great experience working in a group setting and delegating resources to produce a well rounded project.

## **Pacman:** *Understanding Heuristics & Search Algorithms*

####  **Description:**
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this project I worked with the classic game Pacman. In this section we implemented search algoithms, DFS(Depth First Search) and BFS(Breadth First Search) for Pacman agents, and studied the hueristics of a succesful agent. Studying how each search algorithm helps the pacman agents traverse the board with each algorithm with the intended goal of building a pacman agent that wins every game. The implementation of these search algorithms can be found within [search.py](https://github.com/JasperElias/Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio/Pacman/search.py) and [searchAgents.py](https://github.com/JasperElias/Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio/Pacman/searchAgents.py). 

#### **Technologies & Languages:**          
      - PyCharm        - Python

#### **Reflection:**
This project demonstrates my understanding and strength of algorithms and heuristics in artificial intelligence. Requiring a deeper understanding of computers and intense critical thinking, this project shows my strengths as a back-end developer. Most of this project was completed individually, but some sections such as the game logic were pair programmed with my peers. This project shows how I have developed effective problem solving skills and a demonstrates my understanding of software optimization. This project was difficult for me, but after working through the concepts I have a greater understanding of developing AI agents with respect to heuristics searching algorithms.

## **ChatRoom:** *Networks & Protocols*

####  **Description:**
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This chatroom program is a culmination of learning about the inner working of networks. Including network architecture, design and implementation of protocols, network security, port programming, and performance analyzation. Using these skills as a class we designed a protocol for a chatroom application. After splitting into pairs, we implemented this protocol in a chatroom application that we were then able to connect and chat with our peers application versions due to the nature of our protocol. Some code snippits from the Message and messageHandler class are shown below.

#### **Technologies & Languages:**          
      - VSCode        - Java
      
#### **Demo Video/ Visuals:**

*[Message Class](https://github.com/JasperElias/Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio/ChatRoom/Message.java)*
    
    // Enum provides known message types
	public enum MessageType {
		USER_LIST(0),
		JOIN(1),
		LEAVE(2),
		DIRECT_MESSAGE(254),
		BROADCAST_MESSAGE(255);
		public final int controlCode;
		
		// Initialize message's controlCode
		MessageType(final int controlCode) {
			this.controlCode = controlCode;
		}
	}
    
*[MessageHandler Class](https://github.com/JasperElias/Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio/ChatRoom/MessageHandler.java)*

    public MessageHandler(final Message message) {
		int neededCapacity = 5; // Control byte (1 byte) + quantity int (4 bytes)
		final int payloadQuantity = message.getPayloadQuantity();
		for(int payloadIndex = 0; payloadIndex < payloadQuantity; payloadIndex++)      // For each payload:
			neededCapacity += 8 + message.getPayload(payloadIndex).getPayloadLength(); // User id int (4 bytes) + payload length int (4 bytes) + payload
		this.buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(neededCapacity);
		this.buffer.put(this.byteOffset, (byte) message.getMessageType().controlCode);
		this.byteOffset++;
		this.buffer.putInt(this.byteOffset,payloadQuantity);
		this.byteOffset += 4;
		for(int payloadIndex = 0; payloadIndex < payloadQuantity; payloadIndex++)
			this.writePayload(message.getPayload(payloadIndex));
	}
    
    public Message getMessage() {
		final int controlCode = this.buffer.get(this.byteOffset);
		this.byteOffset++;
		final int payloadQuantity = this.buffer.getInt(this.byteOffset);
		this.byteOffset += 4;
		final Message message = new Message(controlCode, payloadQuantity);
		for(int payloadIndex = 0; payloadIndex < payloadQuantity; payloadIndex++) {
			final int userId = this.buffer.getInt(this.byteOffset);
			this.byteOffset += 4;
			message.addPayload(new Message.Payload(userId, this.assemblePayloadBytes()), payloadIndex);
		}
		return message;
	}

#### **Reflection:**
This project was chosen to show my system-level understanding of computers through a network programming. To complete this project I had to learn how to better communicate with my peers when designing our protocol as a group. Over the course of this project I lead class discussions during design meetings and worked to create a collaborative and creative discussion enviorment. Although this became tought I times, I believe the communication skills of my peers and myself improved across the group section of this project. The resulting project demonstrates my knowledge of the relationships within computer systems, but a resulting project that required leadership and collaboration to complete.

 ## **Asteroids:** *Data Structures & Object-Oriented Programming*

####  **Description:**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the object-oriented language Java, I implemented a basic version of the classic arcade game Asteriods. Intended to represent the original game with personal styling choices. Over the course of three milestones of the project, I not only implemented the data structures within the game but provided the game logic. This project re-inforced my understanding of object-oriented programming with data structures, inheritence, and error handling. 

#### **Technologies & Languages:**          
      - Eclipse        - Java
      
#### **Demo Video/ Visuals:**

#### **Reflection:**
Being the first large-scale individual project, I gained the skills of having a larger scope. This project shows a great base level understanding of object-oriented programming. With the addition of writting unit test across the course of the project, I have gained greater knowledge of problem solving using unit tests and debuggers. Although this was one of the first large scale projects, it shows the base of knowledge I have gained over the years of studying computer science.
