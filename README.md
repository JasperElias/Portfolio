&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout studying at Westminster College, not only have I built a great foundation in computer programming but expanded critical thinking, technical writing and communication skills and practices. Outlined below are a set of projects highlighting these skills across all four years of my bachelors degree. <br />

## **SnowPro:** *Mobile Application to record and share snowpack data*

####  **Description:**
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avalanche safety professionals need a mass of accurate snowpack data to build reports and forecast conditions for backcountry users to stay safe when accessing the outdoors.  To help provide data and tools for backcountry users, I designed and implemented a mobile application that the community can use to build a data bank of observations taken in the field.

## **NumberNinja:** *Web Game for Learning Basic Addition/Subtraction*

####  **Description:**
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NumberNinja is a web game designed for learning basic mathematical concepts such as addition, subtraction, and number recognition. Built in a group of four, my main focus was on the back-end implementation of the prompted questions for the students to answer. In the file there is a concept write-up providing more information about the game design and intended goals, as well as the webBuild and the three implementations of the prompted questions. This project gave me great experience working in a group setting and delegating resources to produce a well rounded project.

## **Pacman:** *Understanding Heuristics*

####  **Description:**
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this project I worked with the classic game Pacman. In this section we implemented search algoithms, DFS(Depth First Search) and BFS(Breadth First Search) for Pacman agents, and studied the hueristics of a succesful agent. Studying how each search algorithm helps the pacman agents traverse the board with each algorithm with the intended goal of building a pacman agent that wins every game. This project shows how I have developed effective problem solving skills and a demonstrates my understanding of software optimization. This project was difficult for me, but after working through the concept I have a greater understanding of developing AI agents.

 ## **Asteroids:** *Implementing Data Structures*

####  **Description:**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the object-oriented language Java, I implemented a basic version of the classic arcade game Asteriods. Intended to represent the original game with personal styling choices. Over the course of three milestones of the project, I not only implemented the data structures within the game but provided the game logic. This project re-inforced my understanding of object-oriented programming with data structures, inheritence, and error handling.
